00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,602
Well, so I had a task of deploying this ecommerce

2
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:20,254
website, but I've decided to make it a bit more interesting and

3
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:24,046
do it from the Oracle Virtualbox manager with the

4
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:28,050
help of vagrant and a virtual image of Sentos

5
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,970
nine. As you can see, I've already sshed

6
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,930
from my Ubuntu to the virtual Centos.

7
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,760
I've also configured my Vs code,

8
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,390
it's SH from my Ubuntu to Sentos.

9
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,774
I began with configuring firewall D, which is a dynamic

10
00:00:46,822 --> 00:00:50,546
firewall management tool. It's a high level device that abstracts

11
00:00:50,598 --> 00:00:55,018
away the manual manipulating of iptables.

12
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:58,720
I've used it to split the traffic into

13
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,506
let me just show you here so you

14
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:07,486
can see the 3306. It's the default

15
00:01:07,598 --> 00:01:12,318
port number for the SQL database. In our case it's MariaDB.

16
00:01:12,494 --> 00:01:15,826
And I've created another port which

17
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:19,830
is for the HTP to traffic. The default number is

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,714
80. After that I proceeded

19
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:27,342
with installing MariaDB. Then I created

20
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:30,330
a database by the name of ecomdb.

21
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,410
I run this script over here,

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,754
this SQL script. Then I've installed the

23
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,582
Apache HTTP server. As you can see

24
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:45,194
it's active running. One important thing when configuring

25
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:48,702
the Apache HTTP server is let me just show you, it's to

26
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:52,778
change the default directory index from index HTML

27
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:56,402
to index PhP as it's in our case it's the

28
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:59,506
PHP homepage. If you don't change it,

29
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:03,342
you'll probably be greeted by the default Apache HTML

30
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:06,646
page which you don't really want. And I

31
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,830
think that's all. So let's see, our server is up and running

32
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,110
and we can check the website on localhost 80.

33
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,150
So it just works. This whole thing

34
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,954
was the so called all in one type of deployment

35
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:30,234
architecture, which means basically that all components are installed

36
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:33,742
and run on a single server, which in this case

37
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:37,374
is my virtual centos. Of course this type of

38
00:02:37,412 --> 00:02:41,226
architecture is not recommended for a bigger project because you can hardly

39
00:02:41,258 --> 00:02:44,814
scale up. And also my server is

40
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:48,430
the single point of failure. So if something bad happens

41
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,580
to my pc, well I'm losing my job and my house.
